## Reflection

Project goals included using React technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allows users to pull data from the Exchange rates API and convert currency based on which one they selected. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup.
